# cognate-data-examnum
Four cognate datasets from my master's thesis (Msc in Speech and Language Processing at the University of Edinburgh). I will upload the completed thesis here soon. 

I will also cite the data from https://github.com/j-luo93/DecipherUnsegmented/ properly, but it is cited properly in my thesis. 

Probably better to follow this page though: https://github.com/aceschoff/cognate-data
